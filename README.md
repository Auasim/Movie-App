## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>
A movie app is a mobile application that allows users to search for, discover, and watch movies on their smartphones or tablets. These apps typically provide a user-friendly interface that makes it easy to browse through a vast library of movies, filter by genre, rating, or release date, and find the perfect movie to watch.

Some movie apps also offer additional features such as movie reviews, recommendations, and trailers, as well as the ability to create a personalized watchlist and keep track of what you've watched. Some popular examples of movie apps include Netflix, Hulu, Disney+, Amazon Prime Video, and IMDb.
